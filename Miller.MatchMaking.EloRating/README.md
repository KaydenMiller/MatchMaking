# EloLite
## Usage
Create an `EloRating` using `new EloRating(1000)` where `1000` is the elo value.
You can then perform various actions on the elo ratings such as getting the percentage or the change delta 
that should be used to adjust the ELOs of the associated players. If the player wins they should have their
elo increase where as if they lose they should have their ELO ratings decreased.
